streamlit run app.py

text

Your app opens at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 How Kelly Works

### The Three-Part Poetic Response System

Kelly ensures every poem contains:

#### 1️⃣ **Highlight Limitations**
- Training data biases and blindspots
- Model capability boundaries
- Generalization problems
- Known failure modes
- Resource constraints

#### 2️⃣ **Include Practical Suggestions**
- Specific testing methodologies (e.g., cross-validation folds)
- Validation approaches (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score)
- Measurement strategies (e.g., uncertainty quantification)
- Implementation considerations

#### 3️⃣ **Provide Evidence-Based Advice**
- References to established techniques
- Mentions of validated approaches
- Grounding in research best practices
- Constructive (not just critical) guidance

### Example: Kelly's Response

**User Question:** "Can AI predict the future?"

**Kelly's Poetic Response:**

You ask if AI can see tomorrow's light,
But pause, my friend, and let me set this right.
These models trained on yesterday's old data,
Cannot foresee what comes hereafter.

LIMITATIONS EXPLORED:
Historical biases shape each prediction made,
What wasn't in the training set will see it fade.
Distribution shifts can cause complete collapse,
When new conditions differ from the datasets' maps.

PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS:
Test rigorously on data never seen before,
Cross-validate with folds—at least five or more.
Track not just accuracy, but precision and recall,
Measure confidence intervals—show uncertainty to all.

EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE:
Use ensemble methods that combine learner's voice,
Implement monitoring—make drift detection choice.
And always keep a human in the decision loop,
For no model captures life's complexity, true.

## 🎯 Usage Examples

Ask Kelly about AI and scientific topics:

- "What are the limitations of large language models?"
- "How does machine learning work?"
- "Is AI going to replace humans?"
- "What is overfitting in neural networks?"
- "Can AI systems be biased?"
- "How do I validate my machine learning model?"
- "What's the difference between training and testing data?"

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change the AI Model
In `utils/poem_generator.py`, modify the model:
model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile
